# Implementação e Validação de Autômatos Celulares Elementares Unidimensionais de 2 Qubits por Célula em Computadores Quânticos

## Abstract. 
Quantum Computing has received some attention in the literature
since it’s first appearance, as it is thought to simulate physical systems more
efficiently than classical computing. Similarly, Cellular Automata are a widely
explored computational model, but they have been minimally studied in quantum
computational systems. This paper proposed the implementation of a quantum
one-dimensional elementary cellular automaton with 2-qubits per cell to explore
and analyse the viability of such systems.
